# Primitive Types and Declarations

## The Zero Value
Go assigns a  default zero value to any variable that is declared but not assigned a value.

## Literals

A literal in go refers to writing out a number, character and string.

### Integer
Integer literals are sequences of numbers; they are normally base ten, but different prefixes are used to indicate other
bases: 0b for binary (base two), 0o for octal (base eight), or 0x for hexadecimal (base sixteen).
